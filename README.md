# PictureRes

PictureRes was a starter web project to hone my full-stack development skills.

On the server-side, it utilized a NodeJS and MongoDB backend with Mongoose for schema creation and validation. The client-side was supported with a self-developed frontend of HTML, SCSS/CSS and Javascript.The website also integrates with the OAuth2.0/OpenID framework in order to allow identity federation through Facebook, Google, and Github. 

PictureRes was designed as a ubiquitous hub for art enthusiasts to upload their albums, share their thoughts, and interact with common social media functionality. It was inspired by social media art platforms such as DeviantArt, Pixiv, as well as adopting the commenting framework from Facebook. I started this project as a challenge to  myself to recreate such sites from scratch without guidance, as I had found no tutorials online on how to do so. As I engaged with the project, I quickly discovered why as I navigated the hidden complexities with regards to data modelling/validation, 3rd party authentication and frontend presentation. Currently, I am satisfied with the current result although there is still plenty of room to incorporate additional functionality. In contrast to the aforementioned websites which have a team of dedicated software devlopers behind them, this is a single-person project developed on my free time on weekends, and I'm proud to have been able to create a highly interactive site with decent aesthetics.
